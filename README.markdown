# Skill Folio

This project aims to provide an easy way for people to track their progress in mastery of a discipline.  People should also be able to see what others are working toward as a source of inspiration and direction for what to learn next as well as what steps might be pre-requisite for achieving their goals.

The project currently uses creation and sharing of competency matrices to achieve these goals.  The format for the competency matrices is inspired by [Sijin Joseph's](http://www.indiangeek.net/) [Programmer Competency Matrix](http://www.indiangeek.net/wp-content/uploads/Programmer%20competency%20matrix.htm).

### It should be quick and easy to:
* Create a new matrix
* Update progress on an existing matrix
* Discover other matrices for a given discipline
